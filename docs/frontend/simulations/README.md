# Simulations Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the frontend simulation interface and real-time process control features.

## Overview

The simulations module provides interactive controls for managing business process simulations, including real-time status monitoring, auto-pause functionality, and process optimization features.

## Features

### Real-time Simulations
